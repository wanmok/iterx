/home/svashis3/anaconda3/envs/iterx/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/models/t5/tokenization_t5_fast.py:158: FutureWarning: This tokenizer was incorrectly instantiated with a model max length of 512 which will be corrected in Transformers v5.
For now, this behavior is kept to avoid breaking backwards compatibility when padding/encoding with `truncation is True`.
- Be aware that you SHOULD NOT rely on t5-large automatically truncating your input to 512 when padding/encoding.
- If you want to encode/pad to sequences longer than 512 you can either instantiate this tokenizer with `model_max_length` or pass `max_length` when encoding/padding.
- To avoid this warning, please instantiate this tokenizer with `model_max_length` set to your preferred value.

You are resizing the embedding layer without providing a `pad_to_multiple_of` parameter. This means that the new embedding dimension will be 32100. This might induce some performance reduction as *Tensor Cores* will not be available.
